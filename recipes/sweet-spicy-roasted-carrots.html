    <ul>
      <li>1 serving cooking spray</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter, melted</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon hot honey</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon grated orange zest</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
      <li>1/2 pound baby carrots</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon freshly squeezed orange juice</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray the basket
        with nonstick cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine butter, honey, orange zest, and cardamom in a bowl. Remove 1
        tablespoon of the sauce to a separate bowl and set aside. Add carrots to
        the remaining sauce and toss until all are well coated. Transfer carrots
        to the air fryer basket.
      </li>
      <li>
        Air fry until carrots are roasted and fork tender, tossing every 7
        minutes, for 15 to 22 minutes. Mix orange juice with reserved
        honey-butter sauce. Toss with carrots until well combined. Season with
        salt and pepper.
